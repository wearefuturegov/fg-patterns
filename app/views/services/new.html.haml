  Add a new service

%p
  You can add your own services to the service pattern library. You can also give us extra details like what steps they might include, what type of organisation they sit in or what type of life event they touch on for the user.

= simple_form_for @service do |f|

  = f.input :name, hint: "This is might be what the service is called in your service directory, in your communications or on your website. But also think about what a user might be looking for from a service. For example, ‘register a birth’, ‘apply for a Blue Badge’ or ‘report a flood’."

  = f.input :organisation_types, as: :check_boxes, collection: Service.organisation_types, hint: "We’d like to get a sense of where different services sit in different types of organisations. For example, you can tell us whether a service is in a county, borough or district council.", include_hidden: false

  = f.input :steps, hint: "This is the number of separate steps to complete in order to access an end-to-end service. For example, if users are registering a birth, they will normally be asked to book an appointment and then pay for the service."

    We’re asking for your email address and the name of the organisation that you work for.
    This is so that our moderators can follow up with you if they have a question about the services you have suggested. It might be that we just need a little more detail to complete the entry.
