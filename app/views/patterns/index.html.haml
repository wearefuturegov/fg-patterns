        %p We’ve talked about why we think having  a common set of service patterns across local government would be a great idea.

        %p
          So far, we’ve mapped 157 transactional services, covering everything from ‘register a birth’ to ‘report a pothole’.
          %span.bold And we’ve identified seven common service patterns.

        %p.bold To browse the different service patterns and see some examples of services that use them, click on the buttons below.

        %p You can add your own services to this library and tell us what common pattern(s) they use. There’s also a chance to give us extra details like what steps they include and what type of organisation they sit in.
